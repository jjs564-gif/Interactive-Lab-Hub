In this lab, we want you to design interaction with a speech-enabled device — something that listens and talks to you. This device can do anything *but* control lights (since we already did that in Lab 1). First, we want you to storyboard what you imagine the conversational interaction to be like. Then you will use wizarding techniques to elicit examples of what people might say, ask, or respond. We then want you to use the examples collected from at least two other people to inform the redesign of the device.

We will focus on **audio** as the main modality for interaction to start; these general techniques can be extended to **video**, **haptics** or other interactive mechanisms in the second part of the Lab.

A note on what you are building with. Speech interfaces are usually taught as two boxes — speech-in, speech-out — and that framing hides the part that actually determines whether an interaction works. Between listening and speaking sits the question of **whose turn it is**: when does the device decide you have finished talking, and how long does it make you wait before it answers? This lab gives you direct control over both, and we will ask you to notice what changes when you move them.

## Prep for Part 1: Get the Latest Content and Pick up Additional Parts

Please check instructions in [prep.md](prep.md) and complete the setup.

### Pick up Web Camera If You Don't Have One

Students who have not already received a web camera will receive their Webcam and at the beginning of lab. If you cannot make it to class this week, please contact the TAs to ensure you get these.

### Get the Latest Content

As always, pull updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub to both your Pi and your own GitHub repo.

**\[recommended\]** Option 1: On the Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub`, pull the updates from upstream (class lab-hub) and push the updates back to your own GitHub repo. You will need the *personal access token* for this.

```
pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git pull upstream Fall2026
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git add .
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git commit -m "get lab3 updates"
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub $ git push
```

Option 2: On your own GitHub repo, create a pull request to get updates from the class Interactive-Lab-Hub. After you have the latest updates online, go to your Pi, `cd` to your `Interactive-Lab-Hub` and use `git pull`.

# Part 1

## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment for this lab:

```
pi@ixe00:~$ cd Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab\ 3
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 3 $ python3 -m venv .venv
pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 3 $ source .venv/bin/activate
(.venv) pi@ixe00:~/Interactive-Lab-Hub/Lab 3 $
```

Install the Python dependencies:

```
(.venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This takes a few minutes. If you would like it to take considerably less time, [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a drop-in replacement for `pip` that is dramatically faster on the Pi:

```
(.venv) $ pip install uv && uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the setup script, which installs the classic speech synthesizers, downloads the voice activity detection model, and pre-fetches a neural voice and a speech recognition model so you are not waiting on downloads during lab:

```
(.venv):~$ cd speech-scripts
(.venv) $ ./setup.sh
```

Check your audio devices before going further. `arecord -l` lists capture devices and `aplay -l` lists playback devices; if your webcam microphone or Bluetooth speaker does not appear, fix that first — every script below assumes the system defaults are the ones you want.

## A. Text to Speech

Your Pi can speak in several quite different ways, and the differences are audible in a way that matters for design. In `speech-scripts/` there are shell scripts for each.

### The classic engines

```
(.venv) $ cd speech-scripts

(.venv) $ sudo apt update
(.venv) $ sudo apt install -y espeak festival festvox-kallpc16k

(.venv) $ ./espeak_demo.sh
(.venv) $ ./festival_demo.sh
```

You can run these `.sh` files by typing `./filename`, and read one with `cat filename`. You can also play audio files directly with `aplay filename` — try `aplay lookdave.wav`.

These are all decades-old technology and they sound like it. `espeak-ng` is a *formant synthesizer*: it generates speech from an acoustic model of the vocal tract, which is why it sounds robotic but also why the whole thing fits in a couple of megabytes and responds instantly. `festival` is *concatenative*: they stitch together recorded fragments of a real speaker, which sounds more human but breaks audibly at the seams.

### Neural TTS with Piper

Note that the Piper command line changed in version 1.x — voices are now downloaded explicitly with `python3 -m piper.download_voices`, and you invoke it as `python3 -m piper`. Tutorials you find online may show the old `echo ... | piper --model ...` form, which no longer works. Browse the [voice samples](https://rhasspy.github.io/piper-samples) and download a different one if you'd like:

```
(.venv) $ python3 -m piper.download_voices en_US-lessac-medium
```

[Piper](https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl) synthesizes speech with a small neural network, runs comfortably on the Pi 5, and sounds markedly better than the above.

```
(.venv) $ ./piper_demo.sh
```

The demo script also shows `--output-raw`, which streams audio to the speaker as it is generated rather than writing a file first. Listen for the difference in how quickly speech begins. In a conversational system this gap is the thing your user experiences as responsiveness.

\*\***Write your own shell file to use your favorite of these TTS engines to have your Pi greet you by name.**\*\*
(This shell file should be saved to your own repo for this lab.)

\*\***Then answer: Is the same greeting, in these different voices, the same greeting? Describe one concrete way the voice changed what the utterance seemed to mean or who seemed to be speaking.**\*\*

**The different speech synthesizers gave the Pi noticeably different personalities. eSpeak sounded very robotic and clearly computer-generated, which made the speech feel more mechanical. Festival was somewhat different, but still had the recognizable qualities of traditional synthesized speech. Piper stood out the most to me because it was much smoother and more human-like. When I used Piper for my custom greeting, “Greetings, Jonathan. How are you doing today?”, the natural pacing and pronunciation made the interaction feel much more conversational. This showed me that the choice of speech synthesizer can significantly affect how a user perceives a device, even when the actual words being spoken are similar or even the same.**

## B. Speech to Text

We use [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper), a reimplementation of OpenAI's Whisper model that runs several times faster on CPU and does not require PyTorch. All processing happens on the Pi; nothing is sent to a server.

```
(.venv) $ python transcribe.py lookdave.wav
```

The transcript is not the interesting output here — the timings are. Run it again with a larger model and compare:

```
(.venv) $ python transcribe.py lookdave.wav --model base.en
(.venv) $ python transcribe.py lookdave.wav --model small.en
#  noted that the first run may take longer because the model is downloaded, and that the HF unauthenticated-request warning is expected and not an error.
```

Available sizes, smallest first: `tiny.en`, `base.en`, `small.en`, `medium.en`. The `.en` variants are English-only and faster than their multilingual counterparts at the same size.

\*\***Record a few seconds of your own speech (`arecord -d 5 -f cd -c 1 -r 16000 test.wav`) and transcribe it with at least two model sizes. Report the real-time factor for each. At what point does the accuracy improvement stop being worth the delay, for a system that has to answer you?**\*\*

**I recorded a five-second sample saying, “My Raspberry Pi is running three speech recognition models today.” The tiny.en model had a real-time factor of 0.20x, base.en had a real-time factor of 0.41x, and small.en had a real-time factor of 1.11x. All three models transcribed this relatively simple sentence correctly, so increasing the model size did not provide a meaningful accuracy improvement for this example. However, the transcription delay increased substantially, especially with small.en. For a conversational system that needs to respond quickly, I would choose tiny.en or base.en for this type of speech because they maintained the necessary accuracy while providing much faster responses. The small.en model would only seem worthwhile if the input were difficult enough for the smaller models to make noticeable errors.**

\*\***Write your own script that verbally asks for a numerical input (a phone number, zipcode, number of pets) and records the answer the respondent provides.**\*\* Numbers are a good stress test — transcription systems make characteristic errors on digit strings, and you will want to know what they are before you design around them.

## C. Turn-taking: knowing when someone has stopped talking

Everything so far has worked on fixed audio files. A real conversational device does not get told when to start and stop recording — it has to decide. This is the problem that makes speech interfaces hard, and it is mostly not a speech recognition problem.

We use a **voice activity detector** (VAD) to segment the microphone stream into utterances. `listen.py` runs Silero VAD continuously and hands each detected utterance to faster-whisper:

```
(.venv) $ cd speech-scripts
(.venv) $ python listen.py
```

Speak, pause, and watch it transcribe. Now change the endpointing threshold — the amount of silence the system requires before it decides your turn is over:

```
(.venv) $ python listen.py --min-silence 0.2
(.venv) $ python listen.py --min-silence 1.5
```

\*\***Try both extremes, and something in between. Describe what each one feels like to talk to. Note specifically: at 0.2s, what kinds of normal speech get cut off? At 1.5s, what does the delay make the system seem like?**\*\*

**At 0.2 seconds, the endpointing threshold felt too short and caused normal pauses in my speech to be interpreted as the end of my turn. When I said, “I went to the store, and then I came home to finish my homework,” the system divided the sentence into three separate utterances. This made it feel like the system was impatient and could easily interrupt someone who pauses naturally while speaking.**

**At 1.5 seconds, the opposite happened. The system successfully kept my entire sentence together as one utterance, even with pauses, but the longer silence required before recognizing that I was finished made the interaction feel noticeably slower and less responsive.**

**I also tested an intermediate threshold of 0.6 seconds. This kept my entire sentence together while responding more quickly after I stopped speaking. Of the three values, 0.6 seconds felt the most natural for this type of conversational interaction because it allowed normal pauses without introducing as much delay.**

There is no correct value. A system that takes drink orders and a system that listens to someone think out loud want very different thresholds, and the right one depends on what your users are doing with their pauses.

### The complete loop

`echo_bot.py` puts the pieces together: it listens, endpoints, transcribes, and speaks a reply through Piper. The dialogue policy is deliberately trivial — it repeats what you said — so that everything you notice is a property of the timing rather than the content.

```
(.venv) $ python echo_bot.py
```

## D. Storyboard

Storyboard and/or use a Verplank diagram to design a speech-enabled device. (Stuck? Make a device that talks for dogs. If that is too stupid, find an application that is better than that.)

\*\***Post your storyboard and diagram here.**\*\*

<img width="2668" height="1720" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33b6addc-8996-4e0b-a10f-938e22fc8f77" />


Write out what you imagine the dialogue to be. Use cards, post-its, or whatever method helps you develop alternatives or group responses.

\*\***Please describe and document your process.**\*\*

**I designed a voice-enabled workout assistant that allows a user to interact with their workout plan hands-free. I chose this scenario because speech can be especially useful during exercise, when a user may be holding equipment or moving between sets and may not want to interact with a screen.**

**I first mapped out the basic conversation from starting a set through completing it and beginning the next one. I then added branching responses based on whether the user describes the set as easy, good, or hard. These responses allow the assistant to adjust the next set or rest period while keeping the dialogue simple.**

**I also considered the turn-taking behavior from Part C. I used approximately 0.6 seconds of silence as the endpointing threshold because my testing showed that it allowed natural pauses without creating the longer response delay I noticed at 1.5 seconds. The goal was to make the assistant feel responsive without interrupting the user during normal speech.**

Your script should include the pauses. Where does your device wait, and for how long? You now know from Part C that this is a parameter you have to choose, not something that happens for free.

## E. Acting out the dialogue

Find a partner, and *without sharing the script with your partner* try out the dialogue you've designed, where you (as the device designer) act as the device you are designing. Please record this interaction (for example, using Zoom's record feature).

**Video of the acted out interaction**

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hfbTv0yEHU2LRHh3F0IbNi2G2LUThXWh/view?usp=sharing



\*\***Describe if the dialogue seemed different than what you imagined when it was acted out, and how.**\*\*

**Testing the interaction with my sister acting as the gym-goer showed me how many different directions a workout conversation can take. Even though she is not an avid gym-goer and had not seen my planned dialogue beforehand, the interaction naturally stayed close to the core purpose I had imagined for the voice assistant: providing quick, useful guidance about what the user wants to target and how they want to approach the workout, such as choosing weight, reps, or rest time. The act-out showed me that the exact dialogue can vary significantly between users, while the assistant can still maintain the same overall purpose and structure.**

# Lab 3 Part 2

For Part 2, you will redesign the interaction with the speech-enabled device using the data collected, as well as feedback from part 1.

## Prep for Part 2

1. What are concrete things that could use improvement in the design of your device? For example: wording, timing, anticipation of misunderstandings.
2. What are other modes of interaction *beyond speech* that you might also use to clarify how to interact? In particular: how does someone know when the device is listening, and when it is thinking? You have a screen and an LED.
3. Make a new storyboard, diagram and/or script based on these reflections.
4. (optional) Integrate [input devices](inputs.md) in the system

## Prototype your system

The system should:
* use the Raspberry Pi
* use one or more sensors
* require participants to speak to it

*Document how the system works.*

*Include videos or screencaptures of both the system and the controller.*

**Storyboard of the final system**

## Test the system

Try to get at least two people to interact with your system. (Ideally, you would inform them that there is a wizard *after* the interaction, but we recognize that can be hard.)

Answer the following:

### What worked well about the system and what didn't?
**1. What worked well and what did not work well in your system? The system worked well at creating a clear back-and-forth interaction between the user and VoiceFit. The push-to-talk rotary encoder made the timing of the conversation clear, and users naturally waited for VoiceFit's response before continuing with information about their workout. Speech recognition was generally accurate and the response timing felt smooth. One transcription error occurred when Stephen said "I want to do less reps," which was interpreted as "I want to last rest." There were also a few minor inaccuracies during Arnav's interaction, potentially due to the noise in the room.**

**A larger limitation was the scope of the interaction. Without much initial context, users did not necessarily begin at the point in a workout that the predefined responses assumed. I had to use a custom response almost immediately to establish the conversation. Arnav also quickly moved beyond simple set guidance by asking about exercise selection, sets and reps, and pain. This showed that a real workout assistant would need to support a much broader range of conversation.**
